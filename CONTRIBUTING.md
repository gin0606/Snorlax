Reporting Bugs
--------------

As swift evolves, this project may become out date. Feel free to file issues to
report problems. Be sure to include:

- What platform are you building for? (eg - iOS 9.2, Xcode 7.2.1)
- What package manager are you using? (eg - Cocoapods 1.0.0.beta.4)
    - Swift Package Manager based on what version of swift you're using
    - Cocoapods version can be retrieved via: `pod --version`
    - Carthage version can be retrieved via: `carthage version`
- What is your target configuration? (iOS App, OS X Framework, etc.)

Pull Requests
-------------

This project is history sensitive, so please minimize the amount of arbitrary
commits. The goal is to keep the history readable for someone trying to learn
how to create their own cross-platform libraries.

Please make commits descriptive:

- The title should briefly explain what change was made
- The next several lines can elaborate more on what was changed
- The commit should then explain why it was changed

If you need to modify existing commits you've made, use [rebase
interactive](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History).

Committers will rebase changes onto master and **not** use github's merge feature.
